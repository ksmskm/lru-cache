Hi Kyle,

Thanks again for taking the time to chat with me, I really enjoyed our conversation and learning more about your interest in the role! The next step of our interview process is completing the following coding exercise, which will be reviewed by our very own Chris Werner!

Please see below:

Nice to (virtually) meet you, Kyle.  I'm Chris, a senior developer here at BrandVerity.

Here's the coding challenge, hope you have fun with it!

We would like you to spend no more than 2 hours writing your solution.  This is to limit time required by candidates across the board and provide a level playing field.  If you feel you need a bit more time, please let us know, as we’ve just changed the exercise a bit.
Feel free to do it at a time that is convenient for you, but the sooner you get it back to us the sooner we can move forward.  Please use Python or Java (if using Java, please don't use packages), whichever you are most comfortable with (I've got Python 2.7.10 and Java 1.8.0 on my machine).  If you have a strong reason to use a different language, a different language version, or want to install additional libraries or packages, please email back with details so we can discuss. We’d love to be able to run your program without tweaking our environment.

Please include the following in a zip or tar:

* A short README (or similar) that says how to build the program (if needed), how to run the program, any known issues, limitations, assumptions, and any other details needed.
* The source code you have written.

Solutions to the problem below exist on the internet, but we are going to ask you to pretend that they don't. While we don't mind if you use the internet as you normally would to solve a previously unsolved problem (refreshing yourself general knowledge on syntax, libraries, etc), you should not look at cache algorithms and implementations and things of that sort. We trust that you will follow the spirit of this. 
We are interested in your approach and style, not someone else's. It's more important that it be your own than it be optimal or perfect. Finally, all of the code you supply for this exercise must be your own written from scratch for obvious reasons.  Feel free to use standard language libraries.

With all of that out of the way, the question: 
Design and implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. This is a cache with fixed size in terms of the number of items it holds (supplied at instantiation).  For this exercise, we won’t worry about the number of bytes. Your program can treat the keys and values as strings.  You don’t need to support keys or values that contain spaces.  The cache must allow client code to get items from the cache and set items to the cache. Once the cache is full, when the client wants to store a new item in the cache, an old item must be overwritten or
removed to make room. The item we will remove is the Least Recently Used (LRU) item.  Note that your cache does not need persistence across sessions.

Please read input from stdin and print output to stdout and support the following format (please DO NOT print any kind of a prompt or extra line breaks).
All inputs and outputs exist on their own line:

The first input line should set the max number of items for the cache using the keyword SIZE.  The program should respond with ‘SIZE OK’. This must only occur as the first operation.

Set items with a line giving the key and value, separated by a space, 
your program should respond with 'SET OK'.

Get items with a line giving the key requested, your program should respond with the previously stored value, for example “GOT foo”. If the the key is not in the cache, it should reply with “NOTFOUND”.

‘EXIT’ should cause your program to exit.

If the input is invalid, your program should respond with ‘ERROR’

Sample Input

SIZE 3              SIZE OK
GET foo             NOTFOUND
SET foo 1           SET OK
GET foo             GOT 1
SET foo 1.1         SET OK
GET foo             GOT 1.1
SET spam 2          SET OK
GET spam            GOT 2
SET ham third       SET OK
SET parrot four     SET OK
GET foo             NOTFOUND
GET spam            GOT 2
GET ham             GOT third
GET ham parrot      ERROR
GET parrot          GOT four
EXIT

Expected Output
